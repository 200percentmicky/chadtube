# Prerequisites

To create a Discord music bot with DisTube, you should have a solid understanding of JavaScript. You can make a music bot with very little JS, programming knowledge by using DisTube. But you may get stuck on many uncomplicated issues, and struggle with solutions to incredibly easy problems.

# Preparations

Before diving into this guide, you have to create a Discord bot using Discord.js. If you haven't already, visit [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide/) to familiarize yourself with the process of setting up a basic Discord bot.

This guide is a continuation of your [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide/) development journey, focusing on seamlessly integrating DisTube for advanced music functionality.
The code written follows command handling setup from [discordjs.guide](https://discordjs.guide/), so adjustments may be necessary based on your command handler's structure.
If you encounter any issues, refer to your command handler's documentation or seek assistance in the Discord.js community.
