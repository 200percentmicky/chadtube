## 2. FFMPEG_NOT_INSTALLED

### Reason

- FFmpeg is not installed

### Solution

- Install FFmpeg on: [Windows](http://blog.gregzaal.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows/) - [Linux (Ubuntu, Mint,...)](https://www.tecmint.com/install-ffmpeg-in-linux/)
  > Download FFmpeg from [this repo](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases) if the download links are not available
- If you want to run FFmpeg from a custom path, or `ffmpeg-static`.path, e.t.c., you can use [`ffmpeg.path`](https://distube.js.org/types/DisTubeOptions.html) option.

```ts
import { Events } from "distube";
distube.on(Events.FFMPEG_DEBUG, console.log);
```

## 4.1 Error: Cannot find module '@discordjs/opus'<br/>4.2 RangeError: Source is too large<br/>4.3 RangeError: offset is out of bounds

### Solution

- Install `@discordjs/opus` package. Uninstall `node-opus`, `opusscript` if installed

```sh
npm uninstall opusscript node-opus
npm install @discordjs/opus
```

   You can retry if this function throws the above error.

2. Use a better network service (like the above VPS)

  > You may have to wait for YouTube to unblock your IP after getting this error.

## 2.1 Sign in to confirm you're not a bot<br/>2.2 Get the best YouTube experience

## 4. Error checking for updates: Status code 403

### Reason

- You are requested to github to many times (maybe due to restarting your bot). YouTubePlugin deps check their versions with github api so it can be rate-limited

### Solution

- Disable check for updates temporarily with their env variables

```ts
process.env.YTSR_NO_UPDATE = 1;
process.env.YTDL_NO_UPDATE = 1;
```
